# Simple FD Generator

## Motivation

This is a very simple and probably not a very good peace of software ( was done in 45 min. ).
I had an Assignment in introduction to databases where we should find FD's (functional dependencies) in a file with 44k lines of entities. It seemed like a trivial and time consuming assignment and therefore does this program exists.
